      <p class="founder-text">
        I founded Mimshack Travels with a single goal, to make studying, working, and relocating abroad 
        a reality for as many people as possible. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how stressful and uncertain 
        the travel and visa process can be, and I wanted to change that. With a heart for people and 
        a passion for excellence, I‚Äôve dedicated myself to guiding clients through every step, from 
        admissions and visa applications to relocation support.
      </p>
      <p class="founder-text">
        What sets Mimshack Travels apart is honesty, personalized guidance, and a genuine commitment to 
        each client‚Äôs success. For me, it‚Äôs not just about paperwork, it‚Äôs about dreams, families, and 
        life-changing opportunities. To date, I‚Äôve had the privilege of helping countless students, 
        professionals, and families achieve their goals abroad, and every success story inspires me to 
        do more.
